# portfolio-backend

The API backend for my [portfolio site](https://chris.topher.la) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/christopher-alabada/portfolio)). A basic API written in Python and FastAPI which uses JSON flat files as the data. An AWS serverless framework using Terraform and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
